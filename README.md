Discourse Analysis of the Manosphere  on Forums.red (Red Pill Community)

This project analyzes discourse from the online forum forums.red, a hub for red pill ideology, to understand how masculine identity is shaped through financial advice, self-improvement narratives, and sexual strategy.

Using a mixed-methods approach combining: netnography, topic modeling, and keyword classification, we examine how users frame gender relations through the logic of competition, value, and market exchange.

Our findings show that the forum functions primarily as a space for masculinity guidance, encouraging men to optimize themselves in response to perceived social and sexual hierarchies. Across threads, users draw on economic metaphors like “sexual market value” and “beta provider,” blending self-help rhetoric with evolutionary psychology and neoliberal ideals such as individualism, discipline, and performance.

Overall, the red pill discourse promotes a vision of masculinity rooted in market rationality, where identity, intimacy, and worth are treated as assets to be improved, ranked, and defended. This project highlights how economic reasoning shapes contemporary expressions of masculinity in online communities.

I would get all of this in a prenup so there is no ambiguity. Now, if you simply want to be able to work and earn your own money for the sense of fulfillment it often provides, and it's a hard-need for you, communicate that clearly as a dealbreaker and accept the consequences if it yields a breakup. Strange that he would be springing this on you so late in the game, though. \n",
